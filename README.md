# Pipeline-FIR-filter
In the FIR low-pass filter, the minimum number of taps is used to achieve an allowed deviation < -40 dB.  
In order to reduce the critical path delay, add pipeline to the architecture

## FIR filter design
To generate a FIR low-pass filter with minimum tap count, use the firceqrip() function in MATLAB to find the filter coefficients for the specifications of Fs = 8k, fp = 1.5k, and Î”f = 0.5k.  
```sh
eqnum = firceqrip('minorder',[0.375 0.5],[0.01 0.01]); % eqnum = vec of coeffs
fvtool(eqnum) % Visualize filter
```

Used the coefficients I obtained above to cinstruct a FIR filter:  
```sh
// the FIR filter function
void firFloat(double *coeffs, double *input, double *output,
	int length, int filterLength)
{
	double acc;     // accumulator
	double *coeffp; // coefficients
	double *inputp; // input samples
	int n;
	int k;

	memcpy(&insamp[filterLength - 1], input,
		length * sizeof(double));

	for (n = 0; n < length; n++) {
		coeffp = coeffs;
		inputp = &insamp[filterLength - 1 + n];
		acc = 0;
		for (k = 0; k < filterLength; k++) {
			acc += (*coeffp++) * (*inputp--);
		}
		output[n] = acc;
	}
	memmove(&insamp[0], &insamp[length],
		(filterLength - 1) * sizeof(double));

}
```
## Floating-point and Fixed-point simulation results
Generate three sets of random signed-value signals with a data size of 50,000 each. The following is the simulation result for one of the sets of data.  
![floating](https://github.com/hsieh672/Pipeline-FIR-filter/blob/main/imag/floating.png)  

In fixed-point simulation, because the input signal is random signed-value signals ranging from 0 to 1, a larger number of bits is required to approach saturation for SNR. In order to balance hardware costs and meet the target specifications, a word-length design of 13 bits is adopted, which includes 1 signed-bit, 1 integer part bit, and 11 fractional part bits.

It is difficult to observe the difference between the simulation results of C# and Verilog after passing through the FIR low-pass filter with naked eyes. However, in terms of SNR comparison, the Verilog simulation result is approximately 1.5 dB lower than the C# simulation result.

It is speculated that the reason for this difference is that quantizing the signal reduces the amount of data, which allows for better results with the same precision in computation. However, when considering the precision of the output data, using unquantized signals can achieve more accurate results.

The choice of fixed-point word-length is based on the C# simulation result, which is approximately 2 least significant bits different from the Verilog simulation result, resulting in a lower SNR value. If the goal is to achieve a 50 dB SNR in Verilog simulation results, a word-length of 14 bits can be used, but this will also increase costs.


| SNR\dataset | 1       | 2       | 3       |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| C#          | 50.1709 | 50.0973 | 50.1248 |
| Verilog     | 48.6986 | 48.7159 | 48.6825 |

## Hardware design
![HD](https://github.com/hsieh672/Pipeline-FIR-filter/blob/main/imag/HWDesign.png)  
In the FIR filter architecture shown above, i represents the computation of the i+1th tap, where i = [0:33], for a total of 34 taps. In the upper part of the structure, the output dp_i is the input signal of the next pipeline stage's added D-flip flop. In the lower part of the structure, d(i) is the input signal of the next pipeline stage's added D-flip flop.

Multiplication is calculated using 2's complement for both positive and negative input data. If the input data is negative, it is first converted to a positive value before multiplication, and all multiplication operations are performed through logical operations.

Because the FIR filter coefficients have a symmetric property, only 17 registers are needed to store the coefficient values, reducing hardware usage costs. Specifically, coefficients h17~h0 are reused in taps 18-34.  
## Verilog simulation
X is the input signal, dataout is the output signal, i is the total number of input data, and j is the index of the current input/output data in the total dataset.

## Synthesis
![synthesis](https://github.com/hsieh672/Pipeline-FIR-filter/blob/main/imag/synthesis.png)  

Here I have included the transposed form for comparison, and the clock speed of the transposed form and pipeline architecture has increased by approximately 4.5 times. The clock period is the time required for one multiplier and one adder to complete their operation. The speedup achieved is as expected.  
Although the number of clock cycles required from input to output in the pipeline architecture has increased, the latency is reduced due to the increased clock speed, resulting in a throughput improvement of approximately 2 times.
